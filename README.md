## Requirements and Features
Automated and fully reproducible setup of a Ubuntu Desktop VM making the virtual machine ready for development. By doing this, the virtual machine becomes disposable and can be recreated at any time.

## Usage
Trigger the provisioning of the VM from a bootstrap script. The script installs Ansible and triggers the playbook. The Ansible playbook handles all the installation and configuration steps. A prerequisite is that the VM has internet access and `curl` installed.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sommerfeld-io/vm-ubuntu-desktop/refs/heads/main/components/provision/bootstrap.sh | bash -
```
