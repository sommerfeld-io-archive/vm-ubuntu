## Requirements and Features
Automated and fully reproducible setup of a Ubuntu Desktop VM making the virtual machine ready for development. By doing this, the virtual machine becomes disposable and can be recreated at any time.

## Provisioning
Trigger the provisioning of the VM from a bootstrap script. The script installs all needed packages and configures the VM. However, some manual steps after running the script might still remain.

A prerequisite is that the VM has internet access and `curl` installed.

- Run Bootstrap script:
    ```bash
    sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sommerfeld-io/vm-ubuntu-desktop/refs/heads/main/components/provision/bootstrap.sh | bash -
    ```
- Git might still need some configuration - e.g. `git config --global user.email sebastian@sommerfeld.io` and `git config --global user.name sebastian`.
- Configure public key on GitHub to allow cloning repositories, pulling and pushing via ssh.
- Maybe you still need to add your user from inside the VM to the docker group
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
    ```

## Run locally with Vagrant
To test the provisioning scripts locally, you can use Vagrant. The `Vagrantfile` is already included in this repository. To start/stop the Vagrantbox, simply use the `vagrant.sh` script from the root of this repository (next to the `Vagrantfile`). The `bootstrap.sh` is used to provision the Vagrantbox.

- Maybe you still need to add the `vagrant` user to the docker group (first connect to the Vagrantbox using `vagrant ssh`)
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
    ```

## Download `docker-compose.yml` and start Portainer
To start Portainer, download the `docker-compose.yml` file and start the service. The portainer password is written from the `docker-compose.yml` file to the local filesystem when starting the stack. The password is stored in the textfile `portainer.passwd`.

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sommerfeld-io/vm-ubuntu-desktop/refs/heads/main/components/portainer/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```
